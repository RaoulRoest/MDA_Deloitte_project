A mortgage loan is a common agreement between two parties: the lender and the borrower. 
The lender, mostly banks, lends money to the borrower. The money is 
secured with collateral and in case of default or regular failure to follow 
the agreed payment schedule, the collateral could be sold to obtain the outstanding amount. Within the mortgage 
agreement, a series contractual payments is used to repay the mortgage. 
The contractual payments consist of repayment of the 
mortgage and interest calculated over the outstanding debt. 
The interest can be divided into two groups, one considers a 
fixed interest rate and the other a non-fixed interest rate. The 
interest rate determines the profit of het lender. 
\\\\
A lender takes several risks such as a failing payment of the loanee or 
changing interest rates. Another risk is the loanee to prepay. Repaying 
is paying a part of the borrowed money before the agreed date of the 
scheduled payments. One speaks of partial prepayment when a part of 
the outstanding debt is prepaid. Likewise, a full prepayment is defined 
as prepaying the remaining debt. There is a possibility for the lender 
to charge extra costs for the prepayments. Both the interest and the 
scheduled payments form the income on the lender. If the loanee decides 
to prepay, the interest rate obtained becomes smaller and income 
decreases.  On small scales this gives no problems, however, instead 
of one loanee, a bank can write mortgages to many loanees at once. 
This can result in big losses in comparison to the expected income.  
\\\\
As behaviour of clients can be predicted, extra funds could be kept 
separate to decrease risk without keeping unnecessary reserves. In this 
report there is looked at open-source data collected by FreddieMac and 
aimed to predict prepayments based on this data. The prediction is 
based on lender level. We want to predict prepayments in the next 
timestep for a given time. First, the data is analysed in Section 
\ref{section_data_analysis}. In which also the prepayment rule is 
derived. Followed by the model and performance criteria in Section 
\ref{section_model}. Next, the obtained results are shown in 
Section \ref{section_results}. Last, a discussion is formed, 
consisting of a conclusion, improvements and extensions of the model 
in Section \ref{section_discussion}.

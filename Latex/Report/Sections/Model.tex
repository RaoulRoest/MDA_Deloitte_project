The data has been analysed and a model to predict prepayment need to be chosen. In similar instances, the multinomial logistic model is used often. This is the first model considered.

\subsection{Variable selection}
The importance of variable is derived with use of lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. For a system of equations $$Y=X\beta +\epsilon$$ the lasso estimator is defined by $$min(||Y-X\beta||^2+\lambda||\beta||_1).$$
$\lambda$ denotes the penalty given by lasso regression and determines the bias of the estimator.
